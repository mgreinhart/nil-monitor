Institutions may also not deny or revoke a student athlete's scholarship or deem them ineligible based on their NIL activity and compensation.\nInstitutions may not classify a student athlete as an employee of the school based solely on their athletic participation.\nLimitations on Athletic Association Conduct\nAthletic associations and other regulators may not prevent student athletes or institutions from participating in intercollegiate athletics because of their involvement in NIL activity and compensation.\nViolations and Enforcement\nStudent athletes may seek injunctive relief against an institution or athletic association for a violation of the Arizona NIL law. Institutions may do the same against an athletic association or student athlete. If an institution determines a student athlete has violated the Arizona NIL law, it must notify the student athlete in writing of the determination, after which the student athlete has ten (10) days to correct the violation before the institution can seek injunctive relief."

    "summary": "Permissible NIL Conduct\nArkansas' NIL Law allows a student athlete to enter into a contract and receive compensation for the commercial use of the student athlete\u2019s publicity rights.  As of the April 11, 2023 amendments, student-athletes may now be compensated for NIL use prior to enrollment at an institution.\nInstitutions of higher education, and their supporting foundations, may create, facilitate, or enable opportunities for student-athletes to earn compensation for use of their NIL.  Although, Institutions are not required to create or facilitate these opportunities, nor are institutions required to compensate student-athletes for the institution\u2019s use of the athlete\u2019s publicity rights.\nOrganizations qualified as a 501(c)(3) may compensate student-athletes for use of their NIL.\nProtections for Student-Athletes Engaged in NIL\nInstitutions may not maintain any rule or standard that prevents a student-athlete from earning compensation for use of their NIL. This includes prohibition on altering student-athlete\u2019s scholarship eligibility based on receipt of NIL compensation.\nAthletic associations or conferences may not (a) prevent an athlete from receiving compensation for NIL, (b) penalize the student for receiving such compensation, or (c) prevent an institution from participating in athletics based on an athlete\u2019s receipt of NIL compensation.\nA student-athlete may only rescind an NIL contract, without breach of contract penalty, to the extent they are no longer eligible to participate in any varsity intercollegiate program at an institution of higher education. This provision is far less permissive than its prior iteration, which provided students more opportunities to rescind.\nLimitations on Student Athlete NIL Conduct\nStudent-athletes may not enter into an NIL contract that would:\nRequire them to endorse or promote any product, logo, or business during a practice, competition, or other varsity intercollegiate activity;\nConflict with the policies of the student-athlete\u2019s institution of commitment or enrollment; or\nInvolve the student-athlete\u2019s performance (or lack thereof) in an athletic competition.\nThis law does not authorize the student-athlete to use the name, trademarks, or other intellectual property of the institution at which they are enrolled.\nStudent Athletes Not Employees\nThe act specifies that it does not render student-athletes employees of the institution based on their participation in varsity intercollegiate athletic competition. \nNo Inducement Provision\nNo person or entity may offer or give compensation to a student-athlete enrolled at an Arkansas institution for the purpose of inducing them to transfer for another institution of higher education. The Act creates a cause of action for institutions and third-party licensees for violations of this provision.\nDeclaration of Emergency\nAs part of its new NIL law, Arkansas declared an emergency. In particular, the General Assembly found this Act immediately necessary because recruits for intercollegiate athletics need to know, as soon as practicable, what the NIL rules are, so that they can properly evaluated athletic programs against one another. In so doing, Arkansas referenced the fact that other states are similarly revising their state\u2019s NIL legislation in an attempt to recruit players.\nAdditional Provisions\nArkansas\u2019 NIL law was further amended on April 13, 2023 to prohibit state-funded medical schools from using or offering available funds from state tax revenue for name, image, and likeness payments to students-athletes."

    "summary": "Permissible NIL Conduct\nTennessee's NIL legislation allows student athletes to participate in NIL activities. The May 2025 amendment permits student athletes to receive broad NIL compensation, including for their enrollment at an institution and roster position with the institution's athletic program.\nNeither a grant-in-aid for athletics awarded to a student athlete by an institution nor an institution or its \"affiliated foundation's\" (undefined) involvement in the support of a student athlete's NIL activities constitute NIL compensation. Additionally, receiving permissible NIL compensation does not affect the student athlete's grant-in-aid or athletic eligibility.\nLimitations on Student-Athlete NIL Conduct\nThe legislation contains the traditional options for institutions to limit the use of institutional IP and a prohibition on NIL activities in connection with vice industries, like:\ngambling;\nalcohol;\ntobacco; or\nadult entertainment products.\nRequired NIL Activities\nTennessee colleges are required to conduct a financial literacy workshop for athletes new to the school. In addition, student athletes must now disclose any NIL agreement (and its terms) to the institution and file annual reports with the institution at which they are enrolled. The report must indicate, at a minimum, from whom the athlete is receiving compensation and the amount of compensation.\nPermissible NIL Activities (for Educational Institutions)\nAn April 20, 2022, amendment removed restrictions on institutional activities. Subject to NCAA rules, institutional officials \u2013\u2013 such as coaches \u2013\u2013 can participate in NIL activities, such as maintaining involvement with an NIL collective. Additionally, the legislation permits institutions to set \"reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions\" on NIL activity to avoid it conflicting with team activities or institutional operations. Institutions may prohibit NIL activity where it conflicts with the values of the institution.\nThe May 2024 amendment removed additional restrictions on student athlete NIL compensation. In particular, the act no longer specifies that the compensation must be commensurate with \"fair market value.\" Notably, the legislation removed the language in the statute that had prohibited student athletes from receiving compensation in exchange for athletic performance or attendance at an institution.\nThe May 2025 amendment permits third parties, including institutions and their \"affiliated foundations,\" to compensate student athletes for their NIL, unless such action is prohibited by federal law, court order, or the institution's athletic association. Institutions may adjust a student athlete's need-based financial aid as a result of permissible NIL compensation received by the student athlete.\nLimitations on NIL Activities (for Educational Institutions)\nThe May 2024 amendment prohibits institutions from adopting rules or requirements that \"unduly restrict\" student athletes from receiving NIL compensation. Such compensation does not effect a student's grant-in-aid or athletic eligibility, although, an institution may adjust need-based aid as a result of NIL compensation.\nProtection for Educational Institutions\nInstitutions and their affiliated foundations \"must not be held liable\" for damages resulting from its \"good faith decisions, actions, or involvement\" in NIL activities.\nNIL Agents/Advisors/Representatives\nStudent athletes can retain agents to secure NIL deals. All agents who represent student athletes must be licensed under Tennessee state law. The law also requires institutions to conduct a \"financial literacy workshop\" for student athletes.\nThe May 2024 amendment specifies that parents, siblings, grandparents, spouses, or legal guardians who represent the student athlete are not considered an \"agent\" for the purpose of this law. The same is true of institutions and their affiliated foundations who assist or facilitate NIL opportunities for student athletes.\nIntercollegiate Athletic Associations\nThe May 2024 amendment specifically prohibits any intercollegiate athletic association from interfering with a student athlete's ability to earn compensation, seek representation, or perform due diligence in accordance with the Tennessee statute. The intercollegiate athletic association also may not interfere with the student athlete's eligibility unless the student athlete has committed a violation of the institution's rules.\nThe May 2025 amendment made several changes to the state's NIL laws:\nAthletic associations must preserve all rights afforded to student athletes under applicable state and federal law and preserve all immunities and rights afforded to its member institutions under the same.\nAthletic associations may not establish or adopt any rule or policy that violates state or federal antitrust law.\nAthletic associations may not interfere with an institution's enjoyment of its current and future membership status in the athletic association.\nAthletic associations may not impose unfair, anticompetitive, or unlawful conditions that directly or indirectly compel an institution or student athlete to participate under such conditions or risk violating state or federal law.\nThe athletic association must indemnify and hold harmless the state, its institution, and student athletes from any claims or damages arising from the state's noncompliance or failure under such applicable law.\nPrivate institutions and an athletic association of which the institution is a member may reach a mutual agreement to opt out of these requirements with respect to the institution's student athletes. The opting-out private institution must provide notice to all its student athletes and all members of the athletic association of any mutual opt-out election within thirty (30) days of the mutual election or thirty (30) days of a student athlete's first enrollment at the institution, whichever is sooner.

    "summary": "Permissible NIL Conduct\nVirginia's NIL law allows student athletes to participate in NIL activities, and allows institutions to directly compensate student athletes for use of their name, image, and likeness.\nLimitations on Student Athlete NIL Conduct\nThe law prohibits NIL activities with vice industries, like:\nAlcohol;\nAdult entertainment;\nCannabis or cannabis related products;\nControlled substances;\nPerformance enhancing drugs;\nDrugs;\nTobacco and tobacco products;\nWeapons; and\nGambling and casinos.\nStudent athletes must disclose proposed NIL agreements to institutions prior to execution. If a conflict exists between the student athletes' proposed NIL agreement and the institution's existing agreement, the institution can prohibit the student athlete from entering into such agreement.\nStudent athletes may not use institutional IP without permission from the institution.\nInstitutions may prohibit student athletes from earning NIL compensation while the student athlete is engaged in academic, official team, or athletic department activities.\nAmendment (Passed 4/17/2024; Effective 7/1/2024).\nOn April 17, 2024, Virginia amended its collegiate NIL law to include the following:\nProhibition on Athletic Association Activity\nAthletic associations or conferences may not prevent an institution from compensating a student-athlete for use of their NIL or otherwise prevent an institution (or an entity acting on its behalf) from identifying, creating, or otherwise assisting with NIL opportunities for student-athletes. Athletic associations or conferences cannot open an investigation into, or take adverse action against, an institution or any entity acting on its behalf for permitted NIL activity pursuant to the Virginia law. This includes penalizing an institution or student athlete for conduct by an individual or entity acting on behalf of the institution that violates the association's or conference's NIL rule.\nInstitutional Responsibilities and Limitations\nInstitutions may provide assets or other benefits as an incentive to individuals, companies, or other entities to provide money, benefits, opportunities, or services to an outside entity that supports NIL opportunities for the institution's student athletes.\n\nEach institution must develop policies and procedures governing NIL compensation of student athletes. Those policies must not inhibit the student athlete from participating in activities unrelated to intercollegiate athletics, so long as such participation does not otherwise impact the student athlete's intercollegiate eligibility.\n\nInstitutions may not use \"student fees\" to compensate student-athletes for use of their NIL. These fees are defined as any fee assessed by the institution against a student that is used to support any of the institution's intercollegiate athletic programs.\n\nNeither an institution, its supporting foundations, nor its employees are liable for damages to a student athlete's ability to earn NIL compensation resulting from decisions routinely taken in the course of intercollegiate athletics. If an institution, its supporting foundations, or an entity acting on its behalf is subjected to threatened or actual legal action for engaging in activities permitted by this law, they may bring a suit for damages, attorneys' fees, injunctive relief, and any other legal or equitable remedy.\nStudent Athletes Status as Employees; Right to Injunctive Relief\nThe amendments removed language that definitively stated the student athletes were not employees based on their participation in intercollegiate athletics. Instead, the law now states that the subsection in question does not qualify a student-athlete as an employee solely because that student-athlete engages in NIL opportunities.\n\nA student athlete may bring an action for injunctive relief against an institution or athletic association/conference for violation of any provision of the this law."

Conversely, any institution that is subjected to threatened or actual adverse action — perpetrated by an athletic association, conference, or other organization having authority over collegiate athletics — for engaging in activities authorized by this act may sue to recover (a) actual damages, (b) attorney fees, (c) injunctive relief, and (d) any other remedy in law or equity.\nStudent-Athletes Not Employees\nThe Act explicitly states that it should not be construed to qualify student athletes as employees of an institution solely because they earn NIL compensation from the institution or engage in permitted revenue sharing under this law."
